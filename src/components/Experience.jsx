            I am currently doing an internship as a MERN stack developer, where
            I am honing my skills in both frontend and backend technologies.
            This experience is allowing me to gain practical knowledge in
            building full-stack applications using MongoDB, Express, React, and
            Node.js.

            I have volunteered to teach C++ to students, focusing on developing
            their logical thinking and problem-solving skills. This experience
            has strengthened my ability to explain complex concepts in a clear
            and approachable way.

            I have volunteered to teach computer science to intermediate
            students, helping them get familiar with programming languages and
            guiding them in building strong logic and problem-solving skills.
            This experience has allowed me to inspire and mentor students in
            developing a solid foundation in coding.
